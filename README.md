# Route360

Route360 is an iOS app that generates a running loop of a specified distance that starts from and ends at a user-provided location. Implemented using `MapKit`, `UIKit` and the Core Location framework. 

This project was created by Glen Liu and Joshua Halberstadt as our CS50 final project. The `Documentation` folder contains markdown documents for this project's final report, which includes a report on this app's technical implementation and instructions for running the app on your own simulator or device.
